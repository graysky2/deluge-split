# deluge-split
Finally, an Arch PKGBUILD to provide only needed components/dependencies of deluge.

NOTE - As of [this](https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/trunk?h=packages/deluge&id=c3afc7752a3bf78c334cfe84a86dbdf0bda2e944) commit, Arch is shipping a split deluge package so this PKGBUILD is not adding much value.  I will keep it here but not update it.
